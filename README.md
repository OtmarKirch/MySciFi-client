# A Movie App

## Purpose
In this project, a client-side interface for the movie app "mySciFiApp" is built, complementing the previously developed server-side. Utilizing the React library, several interface views are created to interact with the defined REST API endpoints. The project emphasizes the importance of code readability and maintainability, along with designing a user-friendly interface. By completing this Achievement, a full-stack web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack is developed, demonstrating comprehensive skills in full-stack JavaScript development.

## Hosted
The app is hosted at netlifly. You can take a look at the [finished app here](https://myscifiapp.netlify.app/)

## Database, server and business logic
The database as well as the server providing the data are also projects of mine. You can directly [reach the server here](https://quiet-bastion-19832-9b36523e0b42.herokuapp.com/). There is also a [documentation to use its API](https://quiet-bastion-19832-9b36523e0b42.herokuapp.com/).
You can find the [code for the server in this repository](https://github.com/OtmarKirch/sci-fi-app)


## Current State
The project is now completed.
