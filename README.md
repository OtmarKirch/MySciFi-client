# Purpose
In this project, a client-side interface for the movie app "mySciFiApp" is built, complementing the previously developed server-side. Utilizing the React library, several interface views are created to interact with the defined REST API endpoints. The project emphasizes the importance of code readability and maintainability, along with designing a user-friendly interface. By completing this Achievement, a full-stack web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack is developed, demonstrating comprehensive skills in full-stack JavaScript development.

# Current State
At this stage, the built process using parcel has been implemented. There is one React component to present a list of movies. When clicked on a movie, another component shows details of that movie, including the title, genre and director, as well as a button to return to the list of movies. At the bottom there is a list of movies of the same genre or by the same director. Clicking on these will take the user to the respective movie.
