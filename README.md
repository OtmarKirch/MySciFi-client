# A Movie App

## Purpose
In this project, a client-side interface for the movie app "mySciFiApp" is built, complementing the previously developed server-side. Utilizing the React library, several interface views are created to interact with the defined REST API endpoints. The project emphasizes the importance of code readability and maintainability, along with designing a user-friendly interface. By completing this Achievement, a full-stack web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack is developed, demonstrating comprehensive skills in full-stack JavaScript development.

## Hosted
The app is hosted at netlifly. Take a look at the [finished app here](https://myscifiapp.netlify.app/)

## Database, server and business logic
The movie and user data is managed by a server that implements the business logic by interacting with the database.
The server as well as the database are also projects of mine. You can directly [reach the server here](https://quiet-bastion-19832-9b36523e0b42.herokuapp.com/). 
You can also access the servers public APIs. Find the [documentation here](https://quiet-bastion-19832-9b36523e0b42.herokuapp.com/documentation.html).
You can find the code for the server in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OtmarKirch/sci-fi-app).


## User Experience
The Sci-Fi App is a user-friendly platform designed for movie enthusiasts. It provides a streamlined experience for exploring and learning more about a wide array of movies.

Upon logging in, users are greeted with a clean, intuitive interface showcasing a collection of movies. Each movie is presented in a card format, displaying key information such as the title and a preview image. A simple click on a movie card reveals more detailed information about the movie, including its synopsis and director.

One of the key features of the app is the ability to curate a personal list of favorite movies. Users can easily add or remove movies from their favorites list, providing a personalized browsing experience. This feature makes it easy for users to keep track of the movies they love and want to revisit.

The app also includes a search function, allowing users to quickly find specific movies within the collection. This feature enhances the user experience by making the exploration of the movie collection more efficient and enjoyable.
